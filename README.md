# Audio-Signal-Processing
The main objective of the Audio Signal Processing Application was to automate the audio data processing and export process after an experiment was conducted based from the Sonoscout iPad-based data recorder (~ 90% Accuracy).

The application was built with the Python programming language and PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI) which is one of the popular GUI production modules that provides simplicity and time-saving in the development process.

Scientific and mathematical programming modules such as SciPy and Numpy are used to develop audio data processing and calculation capabilities. These modules provide a wide range of functions essential to developing the Plotting, Export, and Averaging features.
